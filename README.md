# hotas-rs
A experimental project for Rust firmware on a STM32L432KC, intended for use to create a HOTAS system.  
## Status
Since this project is very much "Work-in-progress", there's not a lot of documentation yet. This will come!  
If you need any information, just contact me on my email. I respond pretty quickly :)
# Building
Make sure to make a release build, as there are some problems with debug builds and USB.
